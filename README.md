Quantum mechanics is the study of matter and its interactions with energy on the scale of atomic and subatomic particles. By contrast, classical physics explains matter and energy only on a scale familiar to human experience, including the behavior of astronomical bodies such as the moon. Classical physics is still used in much of modern science and technology. However, towards the end of the 19th century, scientists discovered phenomena in both the large (macro) and the small (micro) worlds that classical physics could not explain.[1] The desire to resolve inconsistencies between observed phenomena and classical theory led to a revolution in physics, a shift in the original scientific paradigm:[2] the development of quantum mechanics.

Many aspects of quantum mechanics are counterintuitive[3] and can seem paradoxical because they describe behavior quite different from that seen at larger scales. In the words of quantum physicist Richard Feynman, quantum mechanics deals with "nature as She is—absurd".[4] Features of quantum mechanics often defy simple explanations in everyday language. One example of this is the uncertainty principle: precise measurements of position cannot be combined with precise measurements of velocity. Another example is entanglement. In certain circumstances, two particles with a shared history may become mutually 'entangled', in which case a measurement made on one particle (such as an electron that is measured to have spin up) will be statistically correlated with the outcome of an equivalent measurement on the other particle (that the other will be more likely to be found to have spin down). This applies even though the particles may be so far apart that it is impossible for the result of the first measurement to have been transmitted to the second particle before the second measurement takes place.

Quantum mechanics helps us understand chemistry, because it explains how atoms interact with each other and form molecules. Many remarkable phenomena can be explained using quantum mechanics, like superfluidity. Liquid helium in a container, cooled to a temperature near absolute zero spontaneously flows up and over the rim of its container, an effect which cannot be explained by classical physics.


## HELLO!!!!!

How old is that claim about Vaporeon? Haven't new Pokemon come out since then?
//Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds

## WELCOME TO MY TED TALK 
Here I will talk about why you should play titanfall 2 firstly it is good (wow), the campaign is very good (very cool respawn), better than stinky apex (I have played alot of apex), multiplayer is a lot of fun (the serevers have some issues), almost always on sale for like $7 (very epic)<br>
thanks for listening now go and get the game :) <br>

"You'll...  ...kill the Children too...?" - Priestess Speaking<br>
"Of course I will. We've destroyed their nest. They'll never forget that. And the survivors of a nest learn, become smarter. There is no reason to let them live." - Goblin Slayer Speaking<br>
"Wh... What if it were a good goblin......?" - Priestess Speaking<br>
"A good goblin? There might be one, if we looked. But I think... ...The only good goblins are the ones who never come out of their stinking holes. That's twenty-two" - Goblin Slayer Speaking<br>
